# Data Driven Decision Making: A Low Code Approach

[![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=armandogarcia17/Data-Driven-Decision-Making-A-Low-Code-Approach)

In this repository, we explore how low-code MATLAB tools can streamline data-driven decision-making. The PDF "CWL Offerings & Support" goes over the available tools and resources for the TAMU community. The other files contain a hands-on case study demonstrating how to improve a manufacturing process using:
1.	Data preparation, analysis, visualization, modeling
2.	Design of experiments (DOE)
3.	Optimization and decision-making techniques.
